# Decibel
A programming language being made for fun

## How to run
the location of the text file to code in Decibel is in ``src/main/grammarRules/test.decibel``.
To run the code in that file, open up cmd to the repository and run ``gradlew decibel``.
For simple testing run ``gradlew run --console=plain`` in cmd to run it in cmd line by line

## How to edit the source code
will write this later
